# VictoryLinux Fedora-Edition

A personal project to setup a fresh Fedora install the way I like it.

Feel free to take, fork, and make your own.

DO NOT JUST RUN THIS. EXAMINE AND JUDGE. RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK.

     git clone https://github.com/VictoryLinux/victory-fedora
     
     chmod +x ~/victory-fedora/*.sh 

     cd victory-fedora
     
     ./install.sh
